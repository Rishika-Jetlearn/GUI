American soldiers stationed in Italy developed a love for the local pizza and brought their enthusiasm for it back home, sparking its boom in the U.S,then being known worldwide!")
    cfacts=chi.config(text="Here‚Äôs a cool fact about chips on their own: the world record for the largest serving of chips was set in 2020 in Melbourne, Australia. Weighing over 1.5 tons (or about 3,000 pounds), this mega-portion used thousands of potatoes and took a team of chefs to pull off. Now that‚Äôs a serious chip craving!")
    bfacts=bur.config(text="Did you know that in the early 2000s, a burger chain called Burger King launched a promotion called the ‚ÄúLeft-Handed Whopper‚Äù? They claimed it was designed specifically for left-handed people, with all the ingredients rotated 180 degrees. It was an April Fools' joke, but many people believed it and even requested it! The fun part? They made a whole marketing campaign around it, and it became a legendary prank in the fast food world!Talk about flipping the script on burgers! üçîü§£")
